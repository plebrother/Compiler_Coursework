#### **2. Week-by-week View**

- **third week(10/03-16/03)**
  1. finish other course's lab and report
  2. get basic understanding of the compiler project
  3. trying to figure out what to do and how to do
  4. try to finish the basic features (failed)

  start working as soon as I woke up, spending most of the day working.

- **fourth week(17/03-21/03)**
  1. finish the basic features and fix bugs
  2. finish parameter and function call
  3. improve code for basic features and recursive funciton call
  4. continue to add features as much as we can

  almost whole day working, going insane.
