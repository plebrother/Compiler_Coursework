### **Project Management & Reflection**

#### **1. Team Work Situation & Reflection**
In this project, our team failed to effectively plan our time and distribute tasks, resulting in actual development work only beginning a week and a half before the deadline. Due to the lack of clear task assignments, we failed to keep an up-to-date tracking of the work we have done.

The main reasons for this situation include:
- **Lack of early planning**: Due to our laziness and arrogance, we heavily underestimated the difficulty and the amount of work needed to be done. Thus, we procrastinated until we finished other course reports and lab orals before we started working.
- **Lack of large project experience**: The lack of familiarity with managing and executing a large-scale project led to difficulties in estimating workload, setting priorities, and getting started.
- **Insufficient communication**: Without regular discussions on project progress, problems were not identified and resolved in a timely manner.

#### **2. Reflection & Improvement Suggestions**
Despite the significant management issues in this project, we learned a lot from this experience and will improve for future projects:
- **Plan ahead**: Establish a detailed timeline at the very beginning of the project and set clear weekly objectives.
- **Task allocation**: Assign specific responsibilities to each team member to ensure workload is evenly distributed.
- **Regular progress updates**: Hold at least one team meeting per week to keep everyone informed about the current progress and upcoming tasks.
- **Use project management tools**: Utilize tools like GitHub Issues, Trello, or Notion to track tasks and log time spent.

### **4. Week-by-week View**

- **third week(10/03-16/03)**
  1. finish other course's lab and report
  2. get basic understanding of the compiler project
  3. trying to figure out what to do and how to do
  4. try to finish the basic features (failed)

  start working as soon as I woke up, spending most of the day working.

- **fourth week(17/03-21/03)**
  1. finish the basic features and fix bugs
  2. finish parameter and function call
  3. improve code for basic features and recursive funciton call
  4. continue to add features as much as we can

  almost whole day working, going insane.
